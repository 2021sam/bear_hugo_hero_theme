You can name this code something like:

### **`generate_gallery_md.py`**

This name reflects its purpose clearly: generating a `gallery.md` file for use in your Hugo site based on images grouped by folders.

# Generate Hugo Gallery Markdown

This utility script (`generate_gallery_md.py`) scans a structured folder of images and generates a `gallery.md` file compatible with a Hugo site using Swiper.js or custom gallery layouts.

## 📂 Folder Structure Expected

The images must be organized like this under `static/images/<page_name>`:

```

static/
└── images/
└── rv-service/
├── slider\_1/
│   ├── img1.jpg
│   └── img2.jpg
├── slider\_2/
│   └── ...
└── slider\_n/

````

## 🛠️ What It Does

- Reads all folders in `static/images/<page_name>` matching the pattern `slider_#`.
- Gathers image URLs in each group.
- Writes a `gallery.md` file with frontmatter defining:
  - `title` (e.g. "Gallery Page")
  - `layout` (e.g. `"gallery"`)
  - `swiperImages1`, `swiperImages2`, ... with the appropriate paths to each image group.
- Appends `Welcome to the Gallery!` body content.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Modify the following variables at the top of the script as needed:

```python
page_name = "rv-service"  # Matches your Hugo image folder
output_md = "gallery.md"
title = "Gallery Page"
layout = "gallery"
````

## 🚀 Usage

From the root of your Hugo project (or wherever the `static` directory is correct):

```bash
python path/to/generate_gallery_md.py
```

This will generate a `gallery.md` file in the current directory.

## 📎 Notes

* Supports `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`
* Ignores non-matching folders and non-image files
* Make sure the image folder is structured and named properly (`slider_1`, `slider_2`, etc.)

```

Let me know if you'd like a version that puts the Markdown directly into `content/gallery.md`, or supports custom layouts.
