## Bear RV, Auto and Truck Collision Center is Dedicated to keeping our Customers Satisfied

With that as our focus, we've developed reliable systems that help us move
each vehicle in and out of the shop as quickly as we can, while keeping the
quality up so that we know that one you roll out, we only see you back when
you need us, not because we missed something.

  
The **BEAR** team includes expert technicians, welders, and painters with the
inspiration and know-how to provide the highest quality work in the industry.
We pride ourselves on delivering the best service because we know that our
reputation and your safety are riding on how well we perform each and every
time.
