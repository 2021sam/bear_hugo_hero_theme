After parts are removed or protected, abrasive blasting exposes clean bare metal and creates a uniform anchor profile for downstream finishing per SSPC surface-preparation guidelines.

## Benefits
- **Consistent anchor profile (SSPC-aligned):** Delivers uniform roughness for reliable downstream adhesion.  
- **Thorough decontamination:** Removes rust, mill scale, failed coatings, and embedded contaminants—even in pits and seams.  
- **Substrate protection:** Calibrated media and pressure prevent distortion or warping and avoid over-cleaning of sound metal.  
- **High throughput / lower downtime:** Automated media recovery maintains steady cut rate on large frames and multi-item batches.

## Applications (Fleet, Industrial, Structural)
- **Fleet & trailers:** Truck/trailer frames, dump bodies, bus/RV frames, chassis components.  
- **Heavy equipment:** Loader arms, buckets, dozer parts, forklifts, attachments, tanks.  
- **Structural & fab:** Beams, columns, handrails, stairs, platforms, guards, enclosures.  
- **Components & parts:** Steel panels, brackets, racks, engine and machine parts (as appropriate to substrate).

We use the right media and pressure to clean without damaging the base metal.
