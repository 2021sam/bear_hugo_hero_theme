We provide precision repair services for a variety of utility trucks — including garbage trucks, concrete pump trucks, and other specialized commercial vehicles. Our technicians restore structural integrity, improve functionality, and extend service life for custom rear bodies and equipment enclosures.

## Utility Truck Repair Services

### Concrete Pump Truck Repair

We service boom pump and line pump trucks with cracked welds, damaged outriggers, or compromised support structures. Repairs include steel reinforcement, deck restoration, and system housing alignment.

### Disposal Truck Door Rebuilds

Rear-load, side-load, and front-load garbage truck doors often suffer impact damage or hydraulic wear. We rebuild or replace doors, seals, hinges, and packing mechanisms for reliable service.

### Fleet Sandblasting & Prep

To ensure long-term durability and professional finish, we offer abrasive blasting for rust removal, paint stripping, and surface prep. This is ideal for fleet restoration or DOT inspections.

### Custom Rear-Body Modifications

Need to add a ladder rack, tool enclosure, or hydraulic access panel? We fabricate and retrofit aluminum or steel rear-body elements to match your vehicle’s operational needs.
