## ðŸ§¼ Sandblasting & Priming

Our industrial-grade sandblasting process strips away rust, paint, grease, and contaminants to prepare metal surfaces for maximum primer adhesion. We handle steel, aluminum, galvanized, and composite substrates.

We then apply fleet-grade primers designed for corrosion control, high-adhesion, and compatibility with urethane, epoxy, or basecoat/clearcoat systems.

## ðŸŽ¯ Fleet Color Matching

We offer precision color matching for utility, municipal, and branded commercial fleets using computer-calibrated spectrophotometers. Whether you're restoring factory finish, matching custom colors, or updating a full fleet, we ensure professional results with minimal downtime.

## ðŸ›¡ Protective Coatings

We apply a variety of durable topcoats designed for extreme-duty use:
- Single-stage and two-stage paint systems
- Urethane and epoxy coatings
- Textured or non-slip surfaces
- High-gloss or matte finishes
- Abrasion, salt, and chemical-resistant options

Common applications include concrete pumpers, refuse trucks, boom service bodies, and utility fleet vehicles exposed to harsh job sites or coastal environments.
