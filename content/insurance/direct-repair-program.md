As an approved **Direct Repair Facility**, **BEAR Collision Center** works directly with major insurance providers like GEICO, Progressive, and State Farm to expedite high-quality repairs for policyholders.

### What Is a DRP?

A **Direct Repair Program** (DRP) is a partnership between an insurance company and a certified auto body repair shop. Through this arrangement:

* The insurer **pre-approves** the facility for repairs
* Estimates, inspections, and claims are **streamlined**
* The shop must meet strict **performance metrics** and **customer satisfaction goals**
* Repairs often come with an **insurance-backed warranty**

California law still allows **you** to choose your own repair shop — even if your insurer recommends a DRP provider. But selecting an approved DRP shop like BEAR makes the process faster and less stressful.
