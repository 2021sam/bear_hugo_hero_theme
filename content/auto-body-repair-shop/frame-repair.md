**BEAR** prides itself on delivering top-quality refinishing services for
vehicles using expert PPG coatings. Our PPG-trained technicians possess deep
expertise in color matching and application techniques, guaranteeing a
flawless finish that restores your vehicle's appearance to its original
beauty. Whether you need a minor touch-up or a complete repaint, our
commitment to excellence and the use of PPG paints ensures that your car not
only looks great but also maintains its value and protection against the
elements.

In addition to vehicle refinishing services, we specialize in creating and
installing custom and replacement decals, stencils, and 3M protective rock
sheets. Our expertise extends to RV decals and vehicle wraps, which can be
ordered directly from the manufacturer or a printing service and installed
onsite. Whether you have a specific custom design or logo in mind for vinyl
decals, or prefer a longer-lasting and more refined painted design, we offer
comprehensive solutions tailored to your preferences. The possibilities for
customization are limitless.
