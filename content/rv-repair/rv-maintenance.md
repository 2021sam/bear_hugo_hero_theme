## Recreation Vehicle (RV) Roof Maintenance: Caulking, Sealing & Water Protection

At **BEAR Collision Service Center**, we specialize in **preventative RV roof maintenance** to protect your investment and prevent costly water damage. Our expert technicians provide thorough inspections, caulking, sealing, and leak prevention services to keep your motorhome, camper, or trailer road-ready and watertight.

### Why RV Roof Maintenance Matters

RV roofs are exposed to the elements year-round — sun, rain, wind, and debris all take a toll. **Even small cracks or failed sealants** can lead to:

* Interior water damage
* Mold or mildew
* Structural rot
* Expensive repairs

**Regular roof maintenance** helps prevent these issues and extends the life of your RV.

### What We Offer

#### ✅ Roof Inspection

We start with a **comprehensive visual inspection** of your entire RV roof — rubber (EPDM), TPO, fiberglass, or aluminum — to identify cracks, loose seams, bubbling, or dried-out caulking.

#### ✅ Professional Caulking & Sealing

We apply **high-quality RV-grade sealants** around:

* Roof edges & seams
* Vents, skylights, antennas
* A/C units, solar panel brackets, ladders

We use industry-approved products like **Dicor® or Alpha Systems®**, ensuring maximum flexibility and adhesion.

#### ✅ Leak Testing & Prevention

We pressure test your RV for leaks and apply protective coatings to vulnerable areas, especially around transitions and joints.

#### ✅ UV Protection & Roof Recoating

We offer **reflective UV-protective coatings** that prevent cracking, chalking, and sun degradation—ideal for RVs exposed to harsh California sunlight.

### Signs Your RV Roof Needs Maintenance

* Black streaks or discoloration
* Soft spots or bubbling under roof membrane
* Cracked or missing sealant
* Water stains on ceiling or walls
