It worked because at every step we aligned Hugo’s **content-to-output mapping**, your **menu URLs**, and the **actual files** on the server:

1. **Leaf-bundle structure**
   You placed your page in:

   ```
   content/rvrepair/index.md
   ```

   Hugo’s convention is:

   ```
   content/<slug>/index.md  →  public/<slug>/index.html
   ```

   With no conflicting `url:` in its front matter, Hugo inferred the URL as `/rvrepair/` and generated `public/rvrepair/index.html`.

2. **Menu link matched the slug**
   Your menu entry used:

   ```toml
   url = "/rvrepair/"
   ```

   And in your template you rendered it with `| relURL` or `| absURL`, so the link became:

   ```
   https://cabear.com/hugo/rvrepair/
   ```

   Matching exactly the folder Hugo created.

3. **Clean FTP deploy**
   By deleting any old folders (`rv-repair/`, stale files) and uploading the fresh `public/` directory—including the new `rvrepair/` folder with its `index.html`—your server now has a physical file at that path. When you navigate to `/hugo/rvrepair/`, Apache finds `public_html/hugo/rvrepair/index.html` and serves it.

### The key takeaways

* **Hugo’s routing is file-based.** The **content path** determines the **output path**.
* **Menu URLs must match the generated paths.** Using `relURL`/`absURL` ensures they respect your `baseURL`.
* **FTP deploy must mirror the `public/` folder exactly.** Any mismatch (old folders, missing files) causes 404s.

By synchronizing these three layers—content structure, menu configuration, and actual deployment—you removed every path mismatch, and **your subpage `/hugo/rvrepair/` finally worked**.
