<p>&ldquo;Michael went above and beyond to help me with another small issue that they
usually don&rsquo;t address but since I was having trouble getting appointments to
handle that at another shop he decided to help me out and take care of it
himself. This RV is my super happy place and it was nice that Michael and the
Team at Bear treated it like was their own happy place.&rdquo; - Heather W. <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/bear-collision-and-service-center-hayward-5">Yelp
