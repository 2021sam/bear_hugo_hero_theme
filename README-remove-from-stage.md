To **stop `/public` from being staged** (i.e., tracked by Git again), you need to:

---

### ✅ 1. Add `/public` to `.gitignore`

Ensure your `.gitignore` has:

```bash
/public
```

> This prevents **new changes** in `/public` from being staged in the future.

---

### ✅ 2. Remove `/public` from Git’s index (staging/tracking), **but keep the folder**

Run:

```bash
git rm -r --cached public
```

> `--cached` removes it **only from Git’s index**, not from your disk.

---

### ✅ 3. Commit the change

```bash
git commit -m "Stop tracking public directory"
```

Now, Git will stop tracking changes in `public/`, and won’t include it in future commits or pushes.

---

### ✅ Optional: Push the update

If you want this change to reflect on the remote:

```bash
git push
```

---

Let me know if you want to track `public/` again later — it’s easy to reverse.
